/** \page dw-miscellaneous Miscellaneous Notes on Dw

This is a barely sorted list of issues which I consider noteworthy,

partly to be created).

General
=======

A **widget allocation outside of the allocation of the parent** is
allowed, but the part outside is not visible.

**Interrupted drawing:** \ref dw-interrupted-drawing.


Floats
======

**Handling collisions:** The CSS specification allows two strategies
to deal with colliding floats: placing the second float beside or
below the first one. Many other browsers implement the first approach,
while dillo implements the second one, which may cause problems when
the author assumes the first. Example: the "tabs" at the top of every
page at Wikipedia ("Article", "Talk", ...).


Positioned elements
===================

**Positioned elements outside of the container:** ...

**Relative positions:** ...

**Fixed positions:** ...
