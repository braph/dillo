README: Last update Oct 2007  --jcid

 This documents need a review. They were current with dillo1 and
now, with dillo2, most of them are obsolete, specially Dw*txt, but
Dw2 is fully documented in html using doxygen.

 The other documents will be reviewed when I have some time. They
will give you an overview of what's going on but take them with a
pinch of salt.

 Of course I'd like to have these as doxygen files too!
If somebody wants to make this convertion, please let me know
to assign higher priority to updating these docs.

 * Ah!, there's a small program (srch) within the src/ dir. It searches
 tokens within the whole code (*.[ch]). It has proven very useful.
 Ex:  ./srch a_Image_write
      ./srch todo:

 * Please submit your patches with 'diff -pru'.


 Happy coding!
