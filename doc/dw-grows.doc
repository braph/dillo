/** \page dw-grows GROWS - Grand Redesign Of Widget Sizes

This paper describes (will describe) some design changes to
calculating widget sizes. Goals are:

- Simplification of widget size calculation by the parent widget;
  dw::Textblock::calcWidgetSize, dw::OutOfFlowMgr::ensureFloatSize
  etc. should become simpler or perhaps even obsolete.

- Making the implementation of some features possible:

  - *max-width*, *max-height*, *min-width*, *min-height*;
  - correct aspect ratio for images with only one percentage size defined;
  - *display: inline-block*;
  - <button>.
