/** \page dw-interrupted-drawing Interrupted drawing

Describing the problem
======================

Without interrupting drawing (which is described below), a widget can
define the order in which its parts (background, non-widget content,
child widgets, etc.) are drawn, but it must be drawn as a whole. There
are situations when this is not possible.

Consider the following simple HTML document:

    <head>
      <style>
	#sc-1 { position: relative; z-index: 1; background: #ffe0e0; }
	#fl-1 { float: right; background: #b0ffb0; }
	#sc-2 { position: relative; z-index: 1; background: #f0f0ff; }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="sc-1">
	<div id="fl-1">
	  Float, line 1/3<br/>
	  Float, line 2/3<br/>
	  Float, line 3/3
	</div>
	Stacking Context 1 
	<div id="sc-2">Stacking Context 2</div>
      </div>
    </body>

The rendering will look loke this:

\image html dw-interrupted-drawing-1.png

Note the missing "Float, line 2/3" of element #fl-1, which is covered
by element #sc-2.

As described in \ref dw-out-of-flow, it has to be distinguished
between the *container* hierarchy (equivalent to the hierarchy of
dw::core::Widget.) and the the *generator* hierarchy. In the following
diagram, the former is represented by solid lines, the latter by
dotted lines:

\dot
digraph G {
   node [shape=rect, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
   edge [arrowhead="vee"];

   "#sc-1" [fillcolor="#ffe0e0", style="filled"];
   "#fl-1" [fillcolor="#b0ffb0", style="filled"];
   "#sc-2" [fillcolor="#f0f0ff", style="filled"];

   "body" -> "#sc-1";
   "body" -> "#fl-1";
   { rank=same; "#sc-1" -> "#fl-1" [style=dotted]; }
   "#sc-1" -> "#sc-2";
}
\enddot


The drawing order of the four elements (represented by widgets) is:

- body,
- #sc-1 (background and text),
- #fl-1,
- #sc-2.

Since 

1. #sc-2 is a child of #sc-1, but
2. #fl-1 is a child of the body, and
3. a widget can only draw its descendants (not neccessary children,
   but drawing siblings is not allowed),

#sc-2 cannot be drawn as a whole; instead drawing is **interrupted**
by #fl-1. This means:

1. the background and text of #sc-1 is drawn;
2. drawing of #sc-1 is **interrupted** by #fl-1, which means that its
   parent, the body, draws #fl-1;
3. drawing of #sc-1 is **continued**, by drawing #sc-2.


When is drawing interrupted?
