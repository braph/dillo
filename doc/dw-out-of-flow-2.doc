/** \page dw-out-of-flow-2 Handling Elements Out Of Flow (cont.)

(Some notes, to be integrated into \ref dw-out-of-flow.)

Constructing a page with floats
-------------------------------
...


Float changes its size
----------------------
The float itself will call queueResize, which will result in a call of
markSizeChange for the *containing* block, which will then call
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::markSizeChange. Here, the vloat is only *marked* as
dirty; the size will be calculated later (in
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::ensureFloatSize).

This will trigger the resize idle function, so sizeRequest and
sizeAllocate for all floats and textblocks. In this run,
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::hasRelationChanged will return *true*, and so result
in a call of dw::Textblock::borderChanged, and trigger a second run of
the resize idle function, dealing correctly with the new size.

(This case is handles in a not perfectly optimal way, since two runs
of the resize idle function are neccessary; but size changes of floats
is not a very common case.

When a page is constructed (see above), a changing size of a float
currently constructed typically only affects the most bottom
textblock; the other textblocks are not covered by this float.)

**Error:** In this case, new collisions are not yet considered.
