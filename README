=======
 Dillo
=======

  This  is a beta release of the next generation of the Dillo web
browser. The code underwent a major rewrite: significant parts of
the  codebase  were  ported  to C++, and the rendering engine now
uses the FLTK2 library instead of GTK1.

Our users will surely enjoy this new release as it will give them
the   same   things  they're  accustomed  plus  tabbed  browsing,
antialiasing,  different  character  sets,  accepting  compressed
pages,  control  over  image  loading,  smaller  footprint, fewer
dependencies, better table rendering, bugfixes, improved GUI, ...
In brief, a better dillo. 


  Here's a list of some well known problems:

         * no FRAMES rendering
         * no https (there's a barebones prototype).
-----
FLTK2
-----

  You can get the fltk2 library from fltk.org.
The recommended version is >= r6403. e.g. in:

  http://fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=2.0.x-r6403


------------
Dpi programs
------------

  These  are  installed by "make install". If you don't have root
access,  copy  "dillo"  and "dpid" to some directory in your path
and  install  the  dpis by running "./install-dpi-local" from the
top directory (they will be installed under ~/.dillo).


----
*BSD
----

  Dillo   compiles on *BSD systems; please report on this anyway,
and note that you'll need GNU make.

  If your dillo crashes or locks at times, just use:

    ./configure --disable-threaded-dns

  so dillo uses a single thread for name resolving.


-------
Solaris
-------

  Dillo may compile and run OK on Solaris but (please report):

    * use gmake (a symbolic link make -> gmake works OK)

  Solaris is very inconsistent so you may need to add/remove:

  -lrt -lposix4

  at link time.
