=======
 Dillo
=======

  This  is  an  alpha release of the next generation of the Dillo
web  browser.  The  code  underwent  a major rewrite: significant
parts  of  the  codebase  were  ported  to C++, and the rendering
engine now uses the FLTK2 library instead of GTK1.

  With  regard to Dillo 0.8.6, dillo-f15f has some advantages (as
antialiasing and utf-8), and some disadvantages. The problems are
simple  to  solve and only need some man months to complete. When
we're  there,  dillo-f15f  will be easily regarded as better than
the former series.

  This is release should be regarded as alpha.


  Here's a list of some well known problems:

    * no iteration inside simple lists
    * image links haven't been hooked yet
    * you may experience crashes from "assert" statements from
      unfinished code.
    * the scrolling position is not yet updated (when following a
      link, the former scroll position is kept).
    * viewport scrolling is not yet optimized (takes lots of CPU)
    * context menus are not yet completely hooked or activated

    * no FRAMES rendering
    * no https            -- read the FAQ to enable a protoype.


------------
Dpi programs
------------

  These  are  installed by "make install". If you don't have root
access,  copy  "dillo"  and "dpid" to some directory in your path
and  install  the  dpis by running "./install-dpi-local" from the
top directory (they will be installed under ~/.dillo).


----
*BSD
----

  Dillo  may  compile on *BSD systems; please report on this.
Please note that you'll need GNU make.

  From  OpenBSD  >=  3.3,  gethost* calls are not thread safe. If
your dillo crashes or locks at times, just use:

    ./configure --disable-threaded-dns

  so dillo uses a single thread for name resolving.


-------
Solaris
-------

  Dillo may compile and run OK on Solaris but (please report):

    * use gmake (a symbolic link make -> gmake works OK)

  Solaris is very inconsistent so you may need to add/remove:

  -lrt -lposix4

  at link time.
