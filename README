 Dillo web browser
===================

dillo-2.2.1 is the last of the dillo-2.x series: 

The 2.x series was based on FLTK-2.0, which was never released.
As distributions have the sensible policy of not including alpha
software, this kept dillo from being provided in their native
packaging systems. 

In response, the core team switched to the more modern FLTK-1.3
which has already seen its first release.

The development effort shifted to the dillo-3.x branch long ago,
and it became the active one (dillo-2.x received less and less
attention).

The new dillo-3.0 will be available in a few weeks, after it passes
the final stages of the release process. It has shown excellent
stability and comes with some nice new features as well.

  Here's a list of some well-known problems of dillo-2.x:

         * no FRAMES rendering
         * no https (there's a barebones prototype).


-----
FLTK2
-----

  The FLTK2 library is statically linked into Dillo2.
The recommended version is >= r6916. and <=r7513
If not available from fltk.org, you can get it here:

  http://www.dillo.org/dillo-2.x/fltk-2.0.x-r7513.tar.bz2


--------------
Building dillo
--------------

  1.- Install fltk:

     tar jxvf fltk-2.0.x-r7513.tar.bz2
     cd fltk-2.0.x-r7513
     less README.unix
     make
     sudo make install
     cd ..
    
  (don't configure fltk with --enable-cairo)

  2.- Then dillo2:

     tar jxvf dillo-2.2.1.tar.bz2
     cd dillo-2.2.1
     ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make
     sudo make install-strip


------------
Dpi programs
------------

  These  are  installed by "make install". If you don't have root
access,  copy  "dillo"  and "dpid" to some directory in your path
and  install  the  dpis by running "./install-dpi-local" from the
top directory (they will be installed under ~/.dillo).


----
*BSD
----

  Dillo   compiles on *BSD systems; please report on this anyway,
and note that you'll need GNU make.

  If your dillo crashes or locks at times, just use:

    ./configure --disable-threaded-dns

  so dillo uses a single thread for name resolving.


-------
Solaris
-------

  Dillo may compile and run OK on Solaris but (please report):

    * use gmake (a symbolic link make -> gmake works OK)

  Solaris is very inconsistent so you may need to add/remove:

  -lrt -lposix4

  at link time.
